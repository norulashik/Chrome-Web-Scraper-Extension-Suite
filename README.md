Chrome Web Scraper Extension Suite
Description
A collection of Chrome extensions designed to scrape text content from websites in three ways:

From the currently open tab

From a list of user-provided URLs

From an entire website including all internal subpages

Each extension allows exporting the collected content into a CSV file for easy use and analysis. Ideal for quick content extraction without needing external tools or coding.

Sub-Projects
1. Current Tab Scraper
Extracts readable content from the current active tab with one click and allows downloading it as CSV.

2. Multi-URL Scraper
Takes a list of URLs and automatically extracts content from each page, compiling the results into a single CSV.

3. Full Website Scraper
Starts from a given homepage and scrapes all internal subpages by recursively following internal links, collecting and exporting all content.
